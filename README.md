# visual-localization

This is my 2017 spring semester project working in LCAV.
More information is written on my report.

Before running this visual localization system, you need to make sure that you have neccesary packages: pkgconfig, opencv and eigen3.
More information is on http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/

After installing these packages, you can run clickme.sh to download Apritags Localization Library.
And don't replace the existing apriltags_demo.cpp file in ./apriltags/example

The version of Python should be Python3.5
